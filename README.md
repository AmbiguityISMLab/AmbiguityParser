# AmbiguityParser
## NSF Grant #1651475. EAGER: An Investigation of the Propagation of Error-Resistant and Error-Prone Messages Over Large-Scale Information Networks.
The aim of the project is to reduce ambiguity of a sentence by determining its phase trees and their probabilities. 
Our web application uses the Java API of the Stanford parser to generate the trees. 
It also has a Twitter module to fetch recent tweets of any user and find ambiguity of the tweets.
